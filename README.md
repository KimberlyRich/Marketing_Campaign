# Marketing Campaign Project

Marketing campaign data of 2,212 customers, including customer profiles, product purchases, campaign successes/failures, and channel performance.

# Problem Statement:
How can we maximize future marketing campaigns to increase number of purchases per campaign by at least 5%, using clustering to isolate biggest buyers, and modify our campaign strategy to align with the needs and behaviors of our target customer?

Recommended Analysis:

1. Which channels (Web, Stores, Catalog) are performing best?
2. Which products are most successful in terms of total revenue?
3. What is the distribution of purchases across the 6 campaign attempts?
4. Can we define demographic attributes, customer life, and amount spent to determine target customers for top 3 products?
5. Identify recommendations for campaign strategy to increase number of purchases across all product lines.

This was an end to end project, beginning with a raw dataset. Data preparation, Data Cleaning, and Data Transformation were done using Python Jupyter Notebook.
Data analysis and visualizations were done using Microsoft Power BI.


Python notebook, Power BI dashboard and Power BI report are attached, as well as the raw and cleaned datasets.
